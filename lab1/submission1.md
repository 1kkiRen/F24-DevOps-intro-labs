# The Importance of Signed Commits

Signed commits are a crucial aspect of maintaining the integrity and authenticity of commits in a Git repository. By signing commits, developers can ensure that the changes made to the codebase are genuine and come from a trusted source.

## Benefits of Signed Commits

* __Verification of Commit Authorship:__ Signed commits allow other developers to verify the identity of the commit author, ensuring that the changes were made by a trusted individual.

* __Prevention of Tampering:__ Signed commits prevent tampering with the commit history, as any changes to the commit would require re-signing with the same key.

* __Improved Security:__ Signed commits provide an additional layer of security, making it more difficult for malicious actors to introduce unauthorized changes to the codebase.

* __Compliance with Regulatory Requirements:__ In some industries, signed commits may be required to meet regulatory compliance standards.
