# Lab 10: Cloud Computing Lab - Artifact Registries and Serverless Computing Platforms

## Task 1: Artifact Registries Research

1. **AWS: Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**

    **Key Features:**

    * Totally integrated Docker registry.
    * Integrated with Amazon EC2 and Amazon ECS.
    * Supports container image vulnerability scanning.
    * Scalable and secure with IAM permissions.
    * Easy integration with CI/CD pipelines.

2. **GCP: Google Artifact Registry**

    **Key Features:**

    * Supports multiple artifact formats (Docker, Helm, etc.).
    * Integrated with GKE and Google Cloud Build.
    * Fine-grained access control with Google IAM.

3. **Azure: Azure Container Registry (ACR)**

    * Supports Helm charts, OCI artifacts, and multi-architecture images.
    * Integrated with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
    * Content trust, geo-replication, and vulnerability scanning.
    * Enhanced security features like private endpoints and firewalls.

## Task 2: Serverless Computing Platform Research

1. **AWS: AWS Lambda**

    **Key Features:**

    * Fully managed serverless compute service that auto-scales.
    * Triggers can be configured for many AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway).
    * Integrated with AWS X-Ray for monitoring and tracing.
    * Pay-per-use model, based on execution time and requests.

2. **GCP: Google Cloud Functions**

    **Key Features:**

    * Automatic scaling based on load.
    * Supports multiple triggers like HTTP, Pub/Sub, Firebase, and Cloud Storage.
    * Native integration with other Google Cloud services.
    * Simple deployment via G-Cloud command-line or UI.

3. **Azure: Azure Functions**

    **Key Features:**

    * Integrates with other Azure services like Blob Storage, Event Grid, and Cosmos DB.
    * Pay-per-use model.
    * Built-in monitoring and logging through Azure Monitor.
